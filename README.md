# Quine

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)]

A program that takes no input and produces its own source code as its output.

## Usage
To get the quine program run the command: `swift main.swift`

This will output to the console the code for a self producing executable. The produced output is identical in behavior to `main.swift` with the current difference being formatting.
